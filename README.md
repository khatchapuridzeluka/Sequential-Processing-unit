## Introduction

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a sequential MIPS processor based on the MIPS Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), using **Verilog HDL** in **Quartus Prime 20.1**.  
The processor is synthesized and tested on the **Cyclone V GX Starter Kit** (Altera/Intel), demonstrating instruction execution and register-level operations.

**Key Features:**
- **Sequential logic design** (Flip-Flops, Counters, Shift Registers)
- **Instruction decoding** for 32-bit MIPS instructions
- **Program Counter (PC)** handling and instruction fetching
- **5-stage MIPS architecture simulation**
- **Hardware testing** using HEX displays and switches
